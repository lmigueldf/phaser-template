Devkit Phaser Template
======================

The purpose for this template is to provide a mechanism by which Phaser games
can integrate themselves with Devkit with relative ease. By instructing a Phaser
game to talk to a Devkit canvas, one can make use of the canvas backend that
Devkit uses for its native mobile builds on Android and iOS.
